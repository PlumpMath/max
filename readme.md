# Max

Max is an experimental mashup of incremental games and the virtual pet craze of the 90s. It was created as part of the Github Game Off 2017 game jam with the theme of "throwback".

The game features a single room that acts as a hub for your interactions with both your pet and the computer that you are using to mine units. Units are the base currency of the game and are mined automatically every second. Additionally, you can also generate units via manual input if you need them in a hurry.

Once you have generated enough units you can use them purchase intensity. Intensity is the second currency in the game and has two purposes: to increase the amount of units you can mine per second and to also feed, clean, and entertain your pet.

As you spend intensity your units per second also decrease, so the challenge of the game is to know when to spend your intensity and when to save it while still maintaining a healthy and happy pet.

The quality of care that you provide for your pet will determine its evolution cycle. So, pay close attention to your pet's stats as it ages to unlock the secrets behind each evolution.

As of this game jam release, the game is essentially "completed" once you reach the final evolution for your pet. You can continue the incremental portion of the game, but there is no new content beyond the final evolution at this time. Once completed, I encourage you to reset your save and play again - caring for your pet differently to see how it affects the evolution cycle.

Thanks so much for playing! This is my first game, and I hope that you will enjoy playing it as much as I have enjoyed learning about game development and creating it.

Note: The music featured in the game was a bit of a stretch goal and I unfortunately didn't get to spend a lot of time working on it so I could safely meet the game jam deadline. If it starts to wear on you, you can mute it by pressing `m` on your keyboard.
